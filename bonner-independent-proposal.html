    <h1>Independent Project Proposal</h1>
        <h2>Portfolio Revamp</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>For my independent project I plan on creating a new website to serve as a virtual portfolio.  
                I currently have a website that I created in my first UX class on WordPress, but would like to redo it on a 
                different platform.  My current portfolio is a little bit unorganized and not super consistent throughout.  
                I would like all of my projects to be easily accessible and relevant to the media and marketing field.  I overall
                would like to have a more professional website.  This project is important so that after graduation in December,
                I have an easily accessible portfolio for potential employers to use as a reference of my skills.
