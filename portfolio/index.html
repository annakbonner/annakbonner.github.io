                    <h3> HELLO, I'M ANNA!</h3>
                    <p> Welcome to my site! I hand-coded this page to serve as a virtual portfolio to showcase my in-class projects and  hands-on experience in the design world! Thank you so much for visiting!</p>
                    <p>I grew up in Northern Virginia, right outside Washington DC and am a student at James Madison University. I am studying in the school of Media Arts and Design and am pursuing a concentration in Interactive Design. Additionally, I am working on minors in General Business and Art.<br>My goal in life is to impact the world in a positive way through my creativity. “It has been said that something as small as the flutter of a butterfly’s wing can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world.” – Chaos Theory</p>
                    <p>Outside of school, some of my hobbies include drawing, reading, traveling, and being outdoors. Most importantly, I work hard to positively impact those around me and hope to continue to do so in whatever career path I take. For more information about me, take a look at my resume below!</p>

                    <p> During a semester-long interactive design project, I worked in a group to research, design, and develop a prototype for an app that maximizes user needs.  My group created "JM[YOU]" to combine online learning tools into a central location.

                    <h4>THE CARING ACT</h4>
                    <p>I had the oppurtunity in one of my visual communication classes to create a non-profit organization in support of the COVID-19 pandemic. After researching effects of COVID on mental health, I created "The Caring Act" and designed a logo and brochure. Take a look at the brochure below!

                    <p> In my "User Experience Research" class, I collected data  on a design question, and proposed a solution as an interactive experience for college students amongst the COVID-19 Pandemic. I did research on how students can remain an active lifestyle despite having to quarantine and avoid contact with others. Check it out below!

                    <p>In my "Interactive Design for the Web" class I learned how to code and was tasked with creating three different websites, all hand-coded.Along with my virtual portfolio,  I was tasked with creating a fake retail site along with a logo. I decided to make a cosmetics company site, check it out below!<br> </p>
